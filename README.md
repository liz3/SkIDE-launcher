# SkIDE updater
From 10th May 2020 the old Updater stopped working due to a change in domains.
This is a simple Script updating a existing installation of SkIDE.

[Download here](https://github.com/liz3/SkIDE-launcher/releases/latest)

To build the standalone binaries run `npm run build`(doesnt work on windows)
